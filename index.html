introduction: |
 I created this website to showcase a lot of the really interesting ecological methods out there that could help us better understand our underwater systems and the organisms that live in them. While my experience has been focused largely on freshwater systems I do have a great appreciation for all aquatic habitats and organisms. With that in mind, I have organized a lot of my content in the form of blog posts that address specific workflows and procedures. These posts will cover a range of taxa and systems butwill hopefully explain the quantitative aspects of the science clearly. In more comprehensive tutorials, I will try to have links to bookdown sites where you can explore content chapter by chapter. I hope that this website serves as helpful resource for your next research project. If you have any ideas for blog posts or other content feel free to reach out to me. 
 
  Here are some of the topics I will focus on:
  - Fisheries and Stock Assessment
  - Aquatic Ecology
  - Data Simulation
  - Frequentist and Bayesian Analyses
  - Spatial Analysis and GIS
 
 Sincerely,
